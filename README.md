# Probabilistic fractal generator
### Requires SFML 2.5.1 and Visual Studio 2019
I found [this video by numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) and I was inspired to code something simple for fun and practice using sfml.

Right now it just runs until you manually close it, but I will later add a small menu for pausing, resuming, stopping, iteration number and other controls and metrics.
