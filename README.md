# Probabilistic fractal generator
### Requires SFML 2.5.1 and Visual Studio 2019
I found [this video by numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) and I was inspired to code something simple for fun and practice using sfml.

I have made an UI, but it is not exactly the best. I improved it a lot in the last commit, but it still is not the best.

I know the UI code is some of the finest italian dishes I made in my life and I need to fix it.

Output examples:

canvas size: 3000x3000 px | window size: irrelevant | number of points: 3
